## Hi ðŸ‘‹
I'm a passionate data professional with a strong technical foundation and a knack for solving complex problems. 

I'm currently working as a Data Integrations Specialist managing intricate data workflows, working with relational databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL and leveraging Python and Bash to streamline processes. I enjoy tackling challenges in data integration and optimization, always aiming to deliver efficient, scalable solutions for our clients. 

At the moment, I'm pursuing a degree in **Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering** to deepen my skills so I can transition into a data engineering role, where I can contribute to building robust and impactful data systems. Let's connect and build something amazing together!
